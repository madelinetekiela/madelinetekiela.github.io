    "title": "The Caitlin Clark Effect on the WNBA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The “Caitlin Clark effect” in many ways was immeasurable. The star out of the University of Iowa racked up numerous awards, school and NCAA records, two national championship appearances, three Big Ten championships, and set more attendance records to count. Clark went on to be one of the most anticipated WNBA draft picks the league has seen in a many years. But did the “Caitlin Clark effect” continue into the W and how much of an impact did this rookie really make for the Indiana Fever? Take a look at her performance by the numbers.\nSince the Fevers last championship in 2012 things went downhill. Even after numerous first round draft picks and repeated attempts at rebuilding, the Fever rarely had a winning record. That is until they were granted the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nwnbarank &lt;- read_csv(\"WNBA Team Rankings - Sheet1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Team, fixed=TRUE)) \n\n\nfever &lt;- wnbarank |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"Indiana Fever\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=wnbarank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank,group= Team, color=Team), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bump(data=fever, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=wnbarank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4, color= \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=fever, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4, color= \"red\") +\n  geom_text(data = wnbarank |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = wnbarank |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023,2024), limits = c(2014, 2026)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(title=\"The Caitlin Clark effect on the Indiana Fever\", subtitle=\"The first overall draft pick led the Fever to their highest ranking since 2016.\", y= \"\", x = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince their 2012 championship the Fever had only made four playoff appearances and have since been in seven-year playoff drought. Clark not only helped them end that drought, but she also helped the Fever bump their rankings up to the highest it’s been since 2016. Proving her value as a player is not just that she is good, she is making an impact.\nSo, the Indiana Fever did a little better, so what? Caitlin was the leader in this improvement, and this is how she did it.\nCaitlin Clark was in what many people saw as the most stacked WNBA draft classes in years. With so much talent some begged the question of where Caitlin would really fall among such talented peers. To see how Caitlin landed among the rookies in her class, take a look at how they compared by average assists, points, and steals.\n\n\nCode\nrookies2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookies2024.csv\")\n\n\nrookies2024 |&gt;\n  filter (MP &gt; 500) |&gt;\n  select(Player,PerGamePTS, PerGameAST, PerGameSTL) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    PerGamePTS = \"Points\",\n    PerGameAST = \"Assists\",\n    PerGameSTL = \"Steals\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2024 WNBA Rookie performances and who lived up to the hype.\",\n    subtitle = \"Caitlin Clark tops her rookie class in points, assists, and steals per game.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maddie Tekiela  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 WNBA Rookie performances and who lived up to the hype.\n\n\nCaitlin Clark tops her rookie class in points, assists, and steals per game.\n\n\nPlayer\nPoints\nAssists\nSteals\n\n\n\n\nKamilla Cardoso\n9.8\n1.7\n0.5\n\n\nCaitlin Clark\n19.2\n8.4\n1.3\n\n\nAaliyah Edwards\n7.6\n1.4\n0.7\n\n\nLeonie Fiebich\n6.7\n1.8\n1.0\n\n\nRickea Jackson\n13.4\n1.5\n0.7\n\n\nAngel Reese\n13.6\n1.9\n1.3\n\n\nJacy Sheldon\n5.4\n2.5\n0.6\n\n\nSevgi Uzun\n4.4\n3.0\n0.9\n\n\nJulie Vanloo\n7.4\n4.3\n0.5\n\n\n\nBy: Maddie Tekiela | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rookie of the year not only led her team in points, assists and steals, she topped her rookie class too. Even in such an anticipated draft class Caitlin landed well above the rest. Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese came in second for points per game averaging 5.6 less than Clark. And Washington Mystics rookie Julie Vanloo averaged 4.1 less assists per game than the Fever star.\nWith a debut season like that Clark had people begin to wonder just how good she would be. How does she rank among the greats? Is this a predictor of how good her WNBA career will be? Is she really a generational talent?\nTo answer some of these questions, take a look at how she compares to all past and present rookies. Pulling from all-time rookie rankings Caitlin landed in the top ten in two categories, assists and points per game.\n\n\nCode\nppg &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookieppg.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; top_n(10, wt=PTS)\n\nassists &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookieassists.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; top_n(10, wt=AST)\n\ncca &lt;- assists |&gt; filter(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\nccp &lt;- ppg |&gt; filter(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\n\npointsbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ppg, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS)) + \n  geom_bar(data=ccp, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS), fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Points Per Game\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nassistsbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=assists, aes(x=reorder(Player, AST), weight=AST)) + \n  geom_bar(data=cca, aes(x=reorder(Player, AST), weight=AST), fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Assists Per Game\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\npointsbar / assistsbar  + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Caitlin Clark Shines in Rookie Season\",\n    subtitle = \"The Fever star finishes her debut season top 10 in all rookie rankings for assist and points pergame\nlanding among WNBA legends.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Maddie Tekiela\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does Clark land among some notable players, but she also broke the record for most points scored in a single season by a rookie with 769 points scored. The 22-year-old phenomenon is now in comparison with players like Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Candace Parker, Maya Moore, and many other league icons.\nIt is far too early to label Caitlin Clark as one of the best the league has ever seen, with a long career ahead of her it is still up in the air. But according to the numbers her future is looking pretty bright, and the “Caitlin Clark effect” might be something worth watching."

    "text": "In 2005, the National Basketball Association (NBA) established a rule prohibiting players from signing with the league until they are at least nineteen years old or one year removed from the graduation of their high school class, a rule commonly referred to as the “one-and-done” policy. The 2006 draft class was the first to be affected by this change.\nSince its implementation, many notable NBA players have entered the draft after just one year of college and gone on to have successful careers. However, in recent years, the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights has encouraged more college athletes to remain at their universities for multiple years. Prominent men’s college basketball stars are increasingly choosing to delay their entry into the draft in order to develop their skills, contribute further to their programs, and, in some cases, continue a lucrative college career.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ndraft24 &lt;- \"https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2024.html\"\n\ndraft24list &lt;- draft24 |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"div_stats\"]') |&gt;\n  html_table(header=FALSE)\n\ndraft24clean &lt;- draft24list[[1]] |&gt; \n  row_to_names(2) |&gt;\n  clean_names() |&gt;\n  mutate_at(1:2, as.numeric) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(rk) == FALSE) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(6:22, as.numeric)\n    \n\noneanddones &lt;- c( \"Reed Sheppard\", \"Stephon Castle\", \"Rob Dillingham\", \"Cody Williams\", \"Bub Carrington\", \"Jared McCain\", \"Ja'Kobe Walter\", \"Yves Missi\", \"Kyshawn George\", \"Isaiah Collier\", \"Johnny Furphy\", \"Cam Christie\", \"Bronny James\")\n\noneanddone&lt;- draft24clean |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% oneanddones)\n\ncollegeplay &lt;- c( \"Donovan Clingan\", \"Zach Edey\", \"Devin Carter\", \"Kel'el Ware\", \"Dalton Knecht\", \"Tristan Da Silva\", \"Jaylon Tyson\", \"DaRon Holmes\", \"Dillon Jones\", \"Terrence Shannon Jr\", \"Ryan Dunn\", \"Baylor Scheierman\", \"Jonathan Mogbo\", \"Kyle Filipowski\", \"Tyler Kolek\", \"Ajay Mitchell\", \"Jaylen Wells\", \"Oso Ighodaro\", \"Adem Bona\", \"KJ Simpson\", \"Pelle Larsson\", \"   \nJamal Shead\", \"Antonio Reeves\", \"Harrison Ingram\", \"Tristen Newton\", \"Enrique Freeman\", \"Quinten Post\", \"Cam Spencer\", \"Anton Watson\", \"Kevin McCullar Jr.\" )\n\ncollege&lt;- draft24clean |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% collegeplay)\n  \n\ntotal &lt;- c(\"College\"= 30, \"One and Done\"= 13, \"International and G League\"=15)\nwaffle(\n        total, \n        rows = 6, \n        colors = c(\"darkblue\", \"red\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    xlab=\"1 square = 1 player\",\n    title=\"More Longtime College Players Drafted to NBA\", \n    subtitle=\"Of the 58 players drafted players with multiple years of college experience\nin the draft outnumbers those who don't.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by Madeline Tekiela\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the most recent NBA Draft, just over half of the first 58 picks had played more than one year of college basketball. The remaining 28 selections consisted of international players, G-League prospects, or athletes who entered the draft after only one year of college.\nTransitioning into a professional league can be challenging for any athlete, which raises an important question: does spending extra time in college help ease that transition? Many players are eager to declare for the draft after a strong college season, hoping to capitalize on their high draft stock and enter the draft when they feel the time is right.\n\n\nCode\nplayers2025 &lt;- load_nba_player_box(2025)\n\nplayerseasonpts&lt;- players2025 |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(game_date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    season_points= sum(points, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nlookingatplayers &lt;- bind_rows(college, oneanddone)\n\nplayersbox&lt;- players2025 |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% lookingatplayers$player) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(game_date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    season_points= cumsum(points)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nwells &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jaylen Wells\")\nkneckt &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Dalton Knecht\")\nfilipowski &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Kyle Filipowski\")\nware &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Kel'el Ware\")\ndasilva &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Tristan da Silva\")\nshead &lt;- playersbox |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jamal Shead\")\n\ntopseason &lt;- playersbox |&gt; group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt; filter(game_date == max(game_date)) |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; filter(season_points &gt; 500)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=playersbox, aes(x=game_date, y=season_points, group=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_step(data=wells, aes(x=game_date, y=season_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=topseason, aes(x=game_date, y=season_points), color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=topseason, aes(x=game_date, y=season_points, label=athlete_display_name), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\" \", \n    y=\"Total Points Scored\", \n    title=\"College Experience Falls Short in Season Point Rankings\", \n    subtitle=\"One-and-dones top rookies in total scoring despite being the minority in their draft class.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Madeline Tekiela\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the top three scorers in the 2024 draft class, two of the three were one-and-done players. In fact, Stephon Castle not only tops his class in points but was also recently voted the NBA’s rookie of the year. The University of Connecticut alum is doing it all at the age of 20 and with only one year of experience with his prior college team.\nHowever, success in college does not always translate to success in the NBA. Entering the draft after only one year raises some important questions. How will limited college experience affect playing time? And how will young players adjust when competing against seasoned professionals on loaded rosters?\n\n\nCode\ndraft24clean |&gt;\n   filter (mp_2 &gt; 23) |&gt;\n  select(player,mp_2, pts_2, ast_2) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    player = \"Player\",\n    pts_2 = \"Points\",\n    ast_2 = \"Assists\",\n    mp_2 = \"Minutes\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who Is Getting More Playing Time?\",\n    subtitle = \"In the top 10 of points per game one-and-dones players \nout number college, international, and G-league players.\"\n) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maddie Tekiela  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Kyshawn George\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Bub Carrington\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Stephon Castle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Jared McCain\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Isaiah Collier\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Yves Missi\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Getting More Playing Time?\n\n\nIn the top 10 of points per game one-and-dones players out number college, international, and G-league players.\n\n\nPlayer\nMinutes\nPoints\nAssists\n\n\n\n\nZaccharie Risacher\n24.6\n12.6\n1.2\n\n\nAlex Sarr\n27.1\n13.0\n2.4\n\n\nStephon Castle\n26.7\n14.7\n4.1\n\n\nBub Carrington\n30.0\n9.8\n4.4\n\n\nJared McCain\n25.7\n15.3\n2.6\n\n\nYves Missi\n26.8\n9.1\n1.4\n\n\nKyshawn George\n26.5\n8.7\n2.5\n\n\nIsaiah Collier\n25.9\n8.7\n6.3\n\n\nJaylen Wells\n25.9\n10.4\n1.7\n\n\nKJ Simpson\n23.4\n7.8\n3.1\n\n\n\nBy: Maddie Tekiela | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix of the top ten rookies in the 2024 NBA season in terms of average minutes played were one-and-done players. This demonstrates that they’re not just entering the draft to get their foot in the door, they are making an immediate impact.\nThe introduction of NIL has drastically changed the landscape of collegiate athletics and continues to influence decisions at the professional level. While the number of one-and-done players has declined in recent years, their presence and performance in the NBA remain significant. Even as more athletes choose to stay in college longer, those who leave early continue to prove they belong in the league."
