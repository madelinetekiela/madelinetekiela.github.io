    "text": "The “Caitlin Clark effect” in many ways was immeasurable. The star out of the University of Iowa racked up numerous awards, school and NCAA records, two national championship appearances, three Big Ten championships, and set more attendance records to count. Clark went on to be one of the most anticipated WNBA draft picks the league has seen in a many years. But did the “Caitlin Clark effect” continue into the W and how much of an impact did this rookie really make for the Indiana Fever? Take a look at her performance by the numbers.\nSince the Fevers last championship in 2012 things went downhill. Even after numerous first round draft picks and repeated attempts at rebuilding, the Fever rarely had a winning record. That is until they were granted the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nwnbarank &lt;- read_csv(\"WNBA Team Rankings - Sheet1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Team, fixed=TRUE)) \n\n\nfever &lt;- wnbarank |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"Indiana Fever\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=wnbarank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank,group= Team, color=Team), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bump(data=fever, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=wnbarank, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4, color= \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=fever, aes(x=Year, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4, color= \"red\") +\n  geom_text(data = wnbarank |&gt; filter(Year == min(Year)), aes(x = Year - .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = wnbarank |&gt; filter(Year == max(Year)), aes(x = Year + .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023,2024), limits = c(2014, 2026)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(title=\"The Caitlin Clark effect on the Indiana Fever\", subtitle=\"The first overall draft pick led the Fever to their highest ranking since 2016.\", y= \"\", x = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince their 2012 championship the Fever had only made four playoff appearances and have since been in seven-year playoff drought. Clark not only helped them end that drought, but she also helped the Fever bump their rankings up to the highest it’s been since 2016. Proving her value as a player is not just that she is good, she is making an impact.\nSo, the Indiana Fever did a little better, so what? Caitlin was the leader in this improvement, and this is how she did it.\nCaitlin Clark was in what many people saw as the most stacked WNBA draft classes in years. With so much talent some begged the question of where Caitlin would really fall among such talented peers. To see how Caitlin landed among the rookies in her class, take a look at how they compared by average assists, points, and steals.\n\n\nCode\nrookies2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookies2024.csv\")\n\n\nrookies2024 |&gt;\n  filter (MP &gt; 500) |&gt;\n  select(Player,PerGamePTS, PerGameAST, PerGameSTL) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    PerGamePTS = \"Points\",\n    PerGameAST = \"Assists\",\n    PerGameSTL = \"Steals\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2024 WNBA Rookie performances and who lived up to the hype.\",\n    subtitle = \"Caitlin Clark tops her rookie class in points, assists, and steals per game.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maddie Tekiela  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 WNBA Rookie performances and who lived up to the hype.\n\n\nCaitlin Clark tops her rookie class in points, assists, and steals per game.\n\n\nPlayer\nPoints\nAssists\nSteals\n\n\n\n\nKamilla Cardoso\n9.8\n1.7\n0.5\n\n\nCaitlin Clark\n19.2\n8.4\n1.3\n\n\nAaliyah Edwards\n7.6\n1.4\n0.7\n\n\nLeonie Fiebich\n6.7\n1.8\n1.0\n\n\nRickea Jackson\n13.4\n1.5\n0.7\n\n\nAngel Reese\n13.6\n1.9\n1.3\n\n\nJacy Sheldon\n5.4\n2.5\n0.6\n\n\nSevgi Uzun\n4.4\n3.0\n0.9\n\n\nJulie Vanloo\n7.4\n4.3\n0.5\n\n\n\nBy: Maddie Tekiela | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rookie of the year not only led her team in points, assists and steals, she topped her rookie class too. Even in such an anticipated draft class Caitlin landed well above the rest. Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese came in second for points per game averaging 5.6 less than Clark. And Washington Mystics rookie Julie Vanloo averaged 4.1 less assists per game than the Fever star.\nWith a debut season like that Clark had people begin to wonder just how good she would be. How does she rank among the greats? Is this a predictor of how good her WNBA career will be? Is she really a generational talent?\nTo answer some of these questions, take a look at how she compares to all past and present rookies. Pulling from all-time rookie rankings Caitlin landed in the top ten in two categories, assists and points per game.\n\n\nCode\nppg &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookieppg.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; top_n(10, wt=PTS)\n\nassists &lt;- read_csv(\"wrookieassists.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; top_n(10, wt=AST)\n\ncca &lt;- assists |&gt; filter(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\nccp &lt;- ppg |&gt; filter(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\n\npointsbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ppg, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS)) + \n  geom_bar(data=ccp, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS), fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Points Per Game\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nassistsbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=assists, aes(x=reorder(Player, AST), weight=AST)) + \n  geom_bar(data=cca, aes(x=reorder(Player, AST), weight=AST), fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Assists Per Game\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\npointsbar / assistsbar  + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Caitlin Clark Shines in Rookie Season\",\n    subtitle = \"The Fever star finishes her debut season top 10 in all rookie rankings for assist and points pergame\nlanding among WNBA legends.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Maddie Tekiela\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does Clark land among some notable players, but she also broke the record for most points scored in a single season by a rookie with 769 points scored. The 22-year-old phenomenon is now in comparison with players like Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Candace Parker, Maya Moore, and many other league icons.\nIt is far too early to label Caitlin Clark as one of the best the league has ever seen, with a long career ahead of her it is still up in the air. But according to the numbers her future is looking pretty bright, and the “Caitlin Clark effect” might be something worth watching."
